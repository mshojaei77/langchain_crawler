Overview Release Policy Packages v0.2 LangChain v0.2 astream_events v2 Changes v0.2 LangChain v0.2 astream_events v2 Changes LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle: Development : Build your applications using LangChain's open-source building blocks , components , and third-party integrations .\nUse LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support. Productionization : Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence. Deployment : Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Cloud . Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries: langchain-core : Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language. langchain-community : Third party integrations. Partner packages (e.g. langchain-openai , langchain-anthropic , etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on langchain-core . Partner packages (e.g. langchain-openai , langchain-anthropic , etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on langchain-core . langchain : Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture. LangGraph : Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.

chains.summarize.chain.load_summarize_chain (llm) chains.summarize.chain.load_summarize_chain chains.summarize.chain.load_summarize_chain Chat Models are a variation on language models. While Chat Models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose\nis a bit different. Rather than expose a “text in, text out” API, they expose\nan interface where “chat messages” are the inputs and outputs. # Examples: ChatOpenAI, ChatGooglePalm chat_models.base.init_chat_model () chat_models.base.init_chat_model chat_models.base.init_chat_model [ Beta ] Initialize a ChatModel from the model name and provider. Embedding models are wrappers around embedding models\nfrom different APIs and services. Embedding models can be LLMs or not. # Examples: OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceEmbeddings embeddings.cache.CacheBackedEmbeddings (...) embeddings.cache.CacheBackedEmbeddings embeddings.cache.CacheBackedEmbeddings Interface for caching results from embedding models. Evaluation chains for grading LLM and Chain outputs. This module contains off-the-shelf evaluation chains for grading the output of\nLangChain primitives such as language models and chains. To load an evaluator, you can use the load_evaluators or load_evaluator functions with the\nnames of the evaluators to load. \"We sold more than 40,000 units last week\" \"How many units did we sell last week?\" The evaluator must be one of EvaluatorType . To load one of the LangChain HuggingFace datasets, you can use the load_dataset function with the\nname of the dataset to load. Some common use cases for evaluation include: Grading the accuracy of a response against ground truth answers: QAEvalChain Grading the accuracy of a response against ground truth answers: QAEvalChain Comparing the output of two models: PairwiseStringEvalChain or LabeledPairwiseStringEvalChain when there is additionally a reference label. Comparing the output of two models: PairwiseStringEvalChain or LabeledPairwiseStringEvalChain when there is additionally a reference label. Judging the efficacy of an agent’s tool usage: TrajectoryEvalChain Judging the efficacy of an agent’s tool usage: TrajectoryEvalChain Checking whether an output complies with a set of criteria: CriteriaEvalChain or LabeledCriteriaEvalChain when there is additionally a reference label. Checking whether an output complies with a set of criteria: CriteriaEvalChain or LabeledCriteriaEvalChain when there is additionally a reference label. Computing semantic difference between a prediction and reference: EmbeddingDistanceEvalChain or between two predictions: PairwiseEmbeddingDistanceEvalChain Computing semantic difference between a prediction and reference: EmbeddingDistanceEvalChain or between two predictions: PairwiseEmbeddingDistanceEvalChain PairwiseEmbeddingDistanceEvalChain PairwiseEmbeddingDistanceEvalChain Measuring the string distance between a prediction and reference StringDistanceEvalChain or between two predictions PairwiseStringDistanceEvalChain Measuring the string distance between a prediction and reference StringDistanceEvalChain or between two predictions PairwiseStringDistanceEvalChain PairwiseStringDistanceEvalChain PairwiseStringDistanceEvalChain These evaluators implement one of the following interfaces: StringEvaluator : Evaluate a prediction string against a reference label and/or input context. StringEvaluator : Evaluate a prediction string against a reference label and/or input context. PairwiseStringEvaluator : Evaluate two prediction strings against each other. Useful for scoring preferences, measuring similarity between two chain or llm agents, or comparing outputs on similar inputs. PairwiseStringEvaluator : Evaluate two prediction strings against each other. Useful for scoring preferences, measuring similarity between two chain or llm agents, or comparing outputs on similar inputs.

LangChain Runnable and the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) . The LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) offers a declarative method to build\nproduction-grade programs that harness the power of LLMs. Programs created using LCEL and LangChain Runnables inherently support\nsynchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations. Support for async allows servers hosting the LCEL based programs\nto scale better for higher concurrent loads. Batch operations allow for processing multiple inputs in parallel. Streaming of intermediate outputs, as they’re being generated, allows for\ncreating more responsive UX. This module contains non-core Runnable classes. An instance of a runnable stored in the LangChain Hub. runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunction runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunction runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunction A function description for ChatOpenAI runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunctionsRouter runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunctionsRouter runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunctionsRouter A runnable that routes to the selected function. This module provides utilities for connecting to LangSmith . For more information on LangSmith, see the LangSmith documentation . LangSmith helps you evaluate Chains and other language model application components using a number of LangChain evaluators.\nAn example of this is shown below, assuming you’ve created a LangSmith dataset called <my_dataset_name> : langchain_community.chat_models # Chains may have memory. Passing in a constructor function lets the # evaluation framework avoid cross-contamination between runs. # Load off-the-shelf evaluators via config or the EvaluatorType (string or enum) # \"Correctness\" against a reference answer \"Do you have to be smarter than a fifth grader to answer this question?\" You can also create custom evaluators by subclassing the StringEvaluator or LangSmith’s RunEvaluator classes. arun_on_dataset : Asynchronous function to evaluate a chain, agent, or other LangChain component over a dataset. arun_on_dataset : Asynchronous function to evaluate a chain, agent, or other LangChain component over a dataset. run_on_dataset : Function to evaluate a chain, agent, or other LangChain component over a dataset. run_on_dataset : Function to evaluate a chain, agent, or other LangChain component over a dataset. RunEvalConfig : Class representing the configuration for running evaluation. You can select evaluators by EvaluatorType or config, or you can pass in custom_evaluators RunEvalConfig : Class representing the configuration for running evaluation. You can select evaluators by EvaluatorType or config, or you can pass in custom_evaluators smith.evaluation.config.EvalConfig smith.evaluation.config.EvalConfig smith.evaluation.config.EvalConfig Configuration for a given run evaluator. smith.evaluation.config.RunEvalConfig smith.evaluation.config.RunEvalConfig smith.evaluation.config.RunEvalConfig Configuration for a run evaluation. smith.evaluation.config.SingleKeyEvalConfig smith.evaluation.config.SingleKeyEvalConfig smith.evaluation.config.SingleKeyEvalConfig Configuration for a run evaluator that only requires a single key. smith.evaluation.progress.ProgressBarCallback (total) smith.evaluation.progress.ProgressBarCallback smith.evaluation.progress.ProgressBarCallback A simple progress bar for the console. smith.evaluation.runner_utils.ChatModelInput smith.evaluation.runner_utils.ChatModelInput smith.evaluation.runner_utils.ChatModelInput smith.evaluation.runner_utils.EvalError (...) smith.evaluation.runner_utils.EvalError smith.evaluation.runner_utils.EvalError Your architecture raised an error. smith.evaluation.runner_utils.InputFormatError smith.evaluation.runner_utils.InputFormatError smith.evaluation.runner_utils.InputFormatError Raised when the input format is invalid. smith.evaluation.runner_utils.TestResult smith.evaluation.runner_utils.TestResult smith.evaluation.runner_utils.TestResult A dictionary of the results of a single test run. smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.ChainStringRunMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.ChainStringRunMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.ChainStringRunMapper Extract items to evaluate from the run object from a chain. smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.LLMStringRunMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.LLMStringRunMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.LLMStringRunMapper Extract items to evaluate from the run object. smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringExampleMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringExampleMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringExampleMapper Map an example, or row in the dataset, to the inputs of an evaluation. smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringRunEvaluatorChain smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringRunEvaluatorChain smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringRunEvaluatorChain Evaluate Run and optional examples. smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringRunMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringRunMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.StringRunMapper Extract items to evaluate from the run object. smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.ToolStringRunMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.ToolStringRunMapper smith.evaluation.string_run_evaluator.ToolStringRunMapper smith.evaluation.name_generation.random_name () smith.evaluation.name_generation.random_name smith.evaluation.name_generation.random_name smith.evaluation.runner_utils.arun_on_dataset (...) smith.evaluation.runner_utils.arun_on_dataset smith.evaluation.runner_utils.arun_on_dataset Run the Chain or language model on a dataset and store traces to the specified project name. smith.evaluation.runner_utils.run_on_dataset (...) smith.evaluation.runner_utils.run_on_dataset smith.evaluation.runner_utils.run_on_dataset Run the Chain or language model on a dataset and store traces to the specified project name.

Causal program-aided language (CPAL) is a concept implemented in LangChain as\na chain for causal modeling and narrative decomposition. CPAL improves upon the program-aided language ( PAL ) by incorporating\ncausal structure to prevent hallucination in language models,\nparticularly when dealing with complex narratives and math\nproblems with nested dependencies. CPAL involves translating causal narratives into a stack of operations,\nsetting hypothetical conditions for causal models, and decomposing\nnarratives into story elements. It allows for the creation of causal chains that define the relationships\nbetween different elements in a narrative, enabling the modeling and analysis\nof causal relationships within a given context.

ATTENTION The schema definitions are provided for backwards compatibility. New agents should be built using the langgraph library\n( https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph )), which provides a simpler\nand more flexible way to define agents. Please see the migration guide for information on how to migrate existing\nagents to modern langgraph agents: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/ Agents use language models to choose a sequence of actions to take. A basic agent works in the following manner: Given a prompt an agent uses an LLM to request an action to take (e.g., a tool to run). Given a prompt an agent uses an LLM to request an action to take (e.g., a tool to run). The agent executes the action (e.g., runs the tool), and receives an observation. The agent executes the action (e.g., runs the tool), and receives an observation. The agent returns the observation to the LLM, which can then be used to generate the next action. The agent returns the observation to the LLM, which can then be used to generate the next action. When the agent reaches a stopping condition, it returns a final return value. When the agent reaches a stopping condition, it returns a final return value. The schemas for the agents themselves are defined in langchain.agents.agent. Represents a request to execute an action by an agent. A representation of an action to be executed by an agent. The final return value of an ActionAgent. The result of running an AgentAction.

Cache provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. Cache is useful for two reasons: It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM\nprovider if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM\nprovider if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make\nto the LLM provider. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make\nto the LLM provider.

LangChain has two main classes to work with language models: Chat Models and “old-fashioned” LLMs . Language models that use a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages\nas outputs (as opposed to using plain text). These are traditionally newer models (\nolder models are generally LLMs, see below). Chat models support the assignment of\ndistinct roles to conversation messages, helping to distinguish messages from the AI,\nusers, and instructions such as system messages. The key abstraction for chat models is BaseChatModel . Implementations\nshould inherit from this class. Please see LangChain how-to guides with more\ninformation on how to implement a custom chat model. To implement a custom Chat Model, inherit from BaseChatModel . See\nthe following guide for more information on how to implement a custom Chat Model: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/custom_chat_model/ Language models that takes a string as input and returns a string.\nThese are traditionally older models (newer models generally are Chat Models, see below). Although the underlying models are string in, string out, the LangChain wrappers\nalso allow these models to take messages as input. This gives them the same interface\nas Chat Models. When messages are passed in as input, they will be formatted into a\nstring under the hood before being passed to the underlying model. To implement a custom LLM, inherit from BaseLLM or LLM .\nPlease see the following guide for more information on how to implement a custom LLM: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/custom_llm/ language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel Abstract base class for interfacing with language models. language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel language_models.chat_models.LangSmithParams language_models.chat_models.LangSmithParams language_models.chat_models.LangSmithParams LangSmith parameters for tracing. language_models.chat_models.SimpleChatModel language_models.chat_models.SimpleChatModel language_models.chat_models.SimpleChatModel Simplified implementation for a chat model to inherit from. language_models.fake.FakeListLLM language_models.fake.FakeListLLM language_models.fake.FakeListLLM language_models.fake.FakeStreamingListLLM language_models.fake.FakeStreamingListLLM language_models.fake.FakeStreamingListLLM Fake streaming list LLM for testing purposes. language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeChatModel Fake Chat Model wrapper for testing purposes. language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeListChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeListChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeListChatModel Fake ChatModel for testing purposes. language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeMessagesListChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeMessagesListChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeMessagesListChatModel Fake ChatModel for testing purposes. language_models.fake_chat_models.GenericFakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.GenericFakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.GenericFakeChatModel Generic fake chat model that can be used to test the chat model interface. language_models.fake_chat_models.ParrotFakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.ParrotFakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.ParrotFakeChatModel Generic fake chat model that can be used to test the chat model interface.

The top container for information is the LLMResult object. LLMResult is used by\nboth chat models and LLMs. This object contains the output of the language\nmodel and any additional information that the model provider wants to return. When invoking models via the standard runnable methods (e.g. invoke, batch, etc.):\n- Chat models will return AIMessage objects.\n- LLMs will return regular text strings. In addition, users can access the raw output of either LLMs or chat models via\ncallbacks. The on_chat_model_end and on_llm_end callbacks will return an\nLLMResult object containing the generated outputs and any additional information\nreturned by the model provider. In general, if information is already available\nin the AIMessage object, it is recommended to access it from there rather than\nfrom the LLMResult object. outputs.chat_generation.ChatGeneration outputs.chat_generation.ChatGeneration outputs.chat_generation.ChatGeneration A single chat generation output. outputs.chat_generation.ChatGenerationChunk outputs.chat_generation.ChatGenerationChunk outputs.chat_generation.ChatGenerationChunk ChatGeneration chunk, which can be concatenated with other ChatGeneration chunks.

A retriever does not need to be able to\nstore documents, only to return (or retrieve) it. Vector stores can be used as\nthe backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well. # Examples: ArxivRetriever, MergerRetriever AsyncCallbackManagerForRetrieverRun Abstract base class for a Document retrieval system. LangChain Runnable and the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) . The LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) offers a declarative method to build\nproduction-grade programs that harness the power of LLMs. Programs created using LCEL and LangChain Runnables inherently support\nsynchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations. Support for async allows servers hosting LCEL based programs to scale better\nfor higher concurrent loads. Batch operations allow for processing multiple inputs in parallel. Streaming of intermediate outputs, as they’re being generated, allows for\ncreating more responsive UX. This module contains schema and implementation of LangChain Runnables primitives.

Cache provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. Cache is useful for two reasons: It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM\nprovider if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM\nprovider if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make\nto the LLM provider. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make\nto the LLM provider.

It is more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to\nstore documents, only to return (or retrieve) it. Vector stores can be used as\nthe backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well. # Examples: ArxivRetriever, MergerRetriever AsyncCallbackManagerForRetrieverRun retrievers.arcee.ArceeRetriever retrievers.arcee.ArceeRetriever retrievers.arcee.ArceeRetriever Arcee Domain Adapted Language Models (DALMs) retriever. retrievers.arxiv.ArxivRetriever retrievers.arxiv.ArxivRetriever retrievers.arxiv.ArxivRetriever retrievers.asknews.AskNewsRetriever retrievers.asknews.AskNewsRetriever retrievers.asknews.AskNewsRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureAISearchRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureAISearchRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureAISearchRetriever Azure AI Search service retriever. retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever Azure Cognitive Search service retriever. retrievers.bedrock.AmazonKnowledgeBasesRetriever retrievers.bedrock.AmazonKnowledgeBasesRetriever retrievers.bedrock.AmazonKnowledgeBasesRetriever Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases retrieval. retrievers.bedrock.RetrievalConfig retrievers.bedrock.RetrievalConfig retrievers.bedrock.RetrievalConfig retrievers.bedrock.VectorSearchConfig retrievers.bedrock.VectorSearchConfig retrievers.bedrock.VectorSearchConfig Configuration for vector search.

chains.summarize.chain.load_summarize_chain (llm) chains.summarize.chain.load_summarize_chain chains.summarize.chain.load_summarize_chain Chat Models are a variation on language models. While Chat Models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose\nis a bit different. Rather than expose a “text in, text out” API, they expose\nan interface where “chat messages” are the inputs and outputs. # Examples: ChatOpenAI, ChatGooglePalm chat_models.base.init_chat_model () chat_models.base.init_chat_model chat_models.base.init_chat_model [ Beta ] Initialize a ChatModel from the model name and provider. Embedding models are wrappers around embedding models\nfrom different APIs and services. Embedding models can be LLMs or not. # Examples: OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceEmbeddings embeddings.cache.CacheBackedEmbeddings (...) embeddings.cache.CacheBackedEmbeddings embeddings.cache.CacheBackedEmbeddings Interface for caching results from embedding models. Evaluation chains for grading LLM and Chain outputs. This module contains off-the-shelf evaluation chains for grading the output of\nLangChain primitives such as language models and chains. To load an evaluator, you can use the load_evaluators or load_evaluator functions with the\nnames of the evaluators to load. \"We sold more than 40,000 units last week\" \"How many units did we sell last week?\" The evaluator must be one of EvaluatorType . To load one of the LangChain HuggingFace datasets, you can use the load_dataset function with the\nname of the dataset to load. Some common use cases for evaluation include: Grading the accuracy of a response against ground truth answers: QAEvalChain Grading the accuracy of a response against ground truth answers: QAEvalChain Comparing the output of two models: PairwiseStringEvalChain or LabeledPairwiseStringEvalChain when there is additionally a reference label. Comparing the output of two models: PairwiseStringEvalChain or LabeledPairwiseStringEvalChain when there is additionally a reference label. Judging the efficacy of an agent’s tool usage: TrajectoryEvalChain Judging the efficacy of an agent’s tool usage: TrajectoryEvalChain Checking whether an output complies with a set of criteria: CriteriaEvalChain or LabeledCriteriaEvalChain when there is additionally a reference label. Checking whether an output complies with a set of criteria: CriteriaEvalChain or LabeledCriteriaEvalChain when there is additionally a reference label. Computing semantic difference between a prediction and reference: EmbeddingDistanceEvalChain or between two predictions: PairwiseEmbeddingDistanceEvalChain Computing semantic difference between a prediction and reference: EmbeddingDistanceEvalChain or between two predictions: PairwiseEmbeddingDistanceEvalChain PairwiseEmbeddingDistanceEvalChain PairwiseEmbeddingDistanceEvalChain Measuring the string distance between a prediction and reference StringDistanceEvalChain or between two predictions PairwiseStringDistanceEvalChain Measuring the string distance between a prediction and reference StringDistanceEvalChain or between two predictions PairwiseStringDistanceEvalChain PairwiseStringDistanceEvalChain PairwiseStringDistanceEvalChain These evaluators implement one of the following interfaces: StringEvaluator : Evaluate a prediction string against a reference label and/or input context. StringEvaluator : Evaluate a prediction string against a reference label and/or input context. PairwiseStringEvaluator : Evaluate two prediction strings against each other. Useful for scoring preferences, measuring similarity between two chain or llm agents, or comparing outputs on similar inputs. PairwiseStringEvaluator : Evaluate two prediction strings against each other. Useful for scoring preferences, measuring similarity between two chain or llm agents, or comparing outputs on similar inputs.

LangChain Runnable and the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) . The LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) offers a declarative method to build\nproduction-grade programs that harness the power of LLMs. Programs created using LCEL and LangChain Runnables inherently support\nsynchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations. Support for async allows servers hosting the LCEL based programs\nto scale better for higher concurrent loads. Batch operations allow for processing multiple inputs in parallel. Streaming of intermediate outputs, as they’re being generated, allows for\ncreating more responsive UX. This module contains non-core Runnable classes. An instance of a runnable stored in the LangChain Hub. runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunction runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunction runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunction A function description for ChatOpenAI runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunctionsRouter runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunctionsRouter runnables.openai_functions.OpenAIFunctionsRouter A runnable that routes to the selected function. This module provides utilities for connecting to LangSmith . For more information on LangSmith, see the LangSmith documentation . LangSmith helps you evaluate Chains and other language model application components using a number of LangChain evaluators.\nAn example of this is shown below, assuming you’ve created a LangSmith dataset called <my_dataset_name> : langchain_community.chat_models # Chains may have memory. Passing in a constructor function lets the # evaluation framework avoid cross-contamination between runs. # Load off-the-shelf evaluators via config or the EvaluatorType (string or enum) # \"Correctness\" against a reference answer \"Do you have to be smarter than a fifth grader to answer this question?\" You can also create custom evaluators by subclassing the StringEvaluator or LangSmith’s RunEvaluator classes. arun_on_dataset : Asynchronous function to evaluate a chain, agent, or other LangChain component over a dataset. arun_on_dataset : Asynchronous function to evaluate a chain, agent, or other LangChain component over a dataset. run_on_dataset : Function to evaluate a chain, agent, or other LangChain component over a dataset. run_on_dataset : Function to evaluate a chain, agent, or other LangChain component over a dataset. RunEvalConfig : Class representing the configuration for running evaluation. You can select evaluators by EvaluatorType or config, or you can pass in custom_evaluators RunEvalConfig : Class representing the configuration for running evaluation.

Causal program-aided language (CPAL) is a concept implemented in LangChain as\na chain for causal modeling and narrative decomposition. CPAL improves upon the program-aided language ( PAL ) by incorporating\ncausal structure to prevent hallucination in language models,\nparticularly when dealing with complex narratives and math\nproblems with nested dependencies. CPAL involves translating causal narratives into a stack of operations,\nsetting hypothetical conditions for causal models, and decomposing\nnarratives into story elements. It allows for the creation of causal chains that define the relationships\nbetween different elements in a narrative, enabling the modeling and analysis\nof causal relationships within a given context.

ATTENTION The schema definitions are provided for backwards compatibility. New agents should be built using the langgraph library\n( https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph )), which provides a simpler\nand more flexible way to define agents. Please see the migration guide for information on how to migrate existing\nagents to modern langgraph agents: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/ Agents use language models to choose a sequence of actions to take. A basic agent works in the following manner: Given a prompt an agent uses an LLM to request an action to take (e.g., a tool to run). Given a prompt an agent uses an LLM to request an action to take (e.g., a tool to run). The agent executes the action (e.g., runs the tool), and receives an observation. The agent executes the action (e.g., runs the tool), and receives an observation. The agent returns the observation to the LLM, which can then be used to generate the next action. The agent returns the observation to the LLM, which can then be used to generate the next action. When the agent reaches a stopping condition, it returns a final return value. When the agent reaches a stopping condition, it returns a final return value. The schemas for the agents themselves are defined in langchain.agents.agent. Represents a request to execute an action by an agent. A representation of an action to be executed by an agent. The final return value of an ActionAgent. The result of running an AgentAction.

Cache provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. Cache is useful for two reasons: It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM\nprovider if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM\nprovider if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make\nto the LLM provider. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make\nto the LLM provider.

LangChain has two main classes to work with language models: Chat Models and “old-fashioned” LLMs . Language models that use a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages\nas outputs (as opposed to using plain text). These are traditionally newer models (\nolder models are generally LLMs, see below). Chat models support the assignment of\ndistinct roles to conversation messages, helping to distinguish messages from the AI,\nusers, and instructions such as system messages. The key abstraction for chat models is BaseChatModel . Implementations\nshould inherit from this class. Please see LangChain how-to guides with more\ninformation on how to implement a custom chat model. To implement a custom Chat Model, inherit from BaseChatModel . See\nthe following guide for more information on how to implement a custom Chat Model: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/custom_chat_model/ Language models that takes a string as input and returns a string.\nThese are traditionally older models (newer models generally are Chat Models, see below). Although the underlying models are string in, string out, the LangChain wrappers\nalso allow these models to take messages as input. This gives them the same interface\nas Chat Models. When messages are passed in as input, they will be formatted into a\nstring under the hood before being passed to the underlying model. To implement a custom LLM, inherit from BaseLLM or LLM .\nPlease see the following guide for more information on how to implement a custom LLM: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/custom_llm/ language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel language_models.base.BaseLanguageModel Abstract base class for interfacing with language models. language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel language_models.chat_models.LangSmithParams language_models.chat_models.LangSmithParams language_models.chat_models.LangSmithParams LangSmith parameters for tracing. language_models.chat_models.SimpleChatModel language_models.chat_models.SimpleChatModel language_models.chat_models.SimpleChatModel Simplified implementation for a chat model to inherit from. language_models.fake.FakeListLLM language_models.fake.FakeListLLM language_models.fake.FakeListLLM language_models.fake.FakeStreamingListLLM language_models.fake.FakeStreamingListLLM language_models.fake.FakeStreamingListLLM Fake streaming list LLM for testing purposes. language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeChatModel Fake Chat Model wrapper for testing purposes. language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeListChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeListChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeListChatModel Fake ChatModel for testing purposes. language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeMessagesListChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeMessagesListChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.FakeMessagesListChatModel Fake ChatModel for testing purposes. language_models.fake_chat_models.GenericFakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.GenericFakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.GenericFakeChatModel Generic fake chat model that can be used to test the chat model interface. language_models.fake_chat_models.ParrotFakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.ParrotFakeChatModel language_models.fake_chat_models.ParrotFakeChatModel Generic fake chat model that can be used to test the chat model interface.

The top container for information is the LLMResult object. LLMResult is used by\nboth chat models and LLMs. This object contains the output of the language\nmodel and any additional information that the model provider wants to return. When invoking models via the standard runnable methods (e.g. invoke, batch, etc.):\n- Chat models will return AIMessage objects.\n- LLMs will return regular text strings. In addition, users can access the raw output of either LLMs or chat models via\ncallbacks. The on_chat_model_end and on_llm_end callbacks will return an\nLLMResult object containing the generated outputs and any additional information\nreturned by the model provider. In general, if information is already available\nin the AIMessage object, it is recommended to access it from there rather than\nfrom the LLMResult object. outputs.chat_generation.ChatGeneration outputs.chat_generation.ChatGeneration outputs.chat_generation.ChatGeneration A single chat generation output. outputs.chat_generation.ChatGenerationChunk outputs.chat_generation.ChatGenerationChunk outputs.chat_generation.ChatGenerationChunk ChatGeneration chunk, which can be concatenated with other ChatGeneration chunks.

A retriever does not need to be able to\nstore documents, only to return (or retrieve) it. Vector stores can be used as\nthe backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well. # Examples: ArxivRetriever, MergerRetriever AsyncCallbackManagerForRetrieverRun Abstract base class for a Document retrieval system. LangChain Runnable and the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) . The LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) offers a declarative method to build\nproduction-grade programs that harness the power of LLMs. Programs created using LCEL and LangChain Runnables inherently support\nsynchronous, asynchronous, batch, and streaming operations. Support for async allows servers hosting LCEL based programs to scale better\nfor higher concurrent loads. Batch operations allow for processing multiple inputs in parallel. Streaming of intermediate outputs, as they’re being generated, allows for\ncreating more responsive UX. This module contains schema and implementation of LangChain Runnables primitives.

Cache provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. Cache is useful for two reasons: It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM\nprovider if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM\nprovider if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make\nto the LLM provider. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make\nto the LLM provider.

It is more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to\nstore documents, only to return (or retrieve) it. Vector stores can be used as\nthe backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well. # Examples: ArxivRetriever, MergerRetriever AsyncCallbackManagerForRetrieverRun retrievers.arcee.ArceeRetriever retrievers.arcee.ArceeRetriever retrievers.arcee.ArceeRetriever Arcee Domain Adapted Language Models (DALMs) retriever. retrievers.arxiv.ArxivRetriever retrievers.arxiv.ArxivRetriever retrievers.arxiv.ArxivRetriever retrievers.asknews.AskNewsRetriever retrievers.asknews.AskNewsRetriever retrievers.asknews.AskNewsRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureAISearchRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureAISearchRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureAISearchRetriever Azure AI Search service retriever. retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever retrievers.azure_ai_search.AzureCognitiveSearchRetriever Azure Cognitive Search service retriever. retrievers.bedrock.AmazonKnowledgeBasesRetriever retrievers.bedrock.AmazonKnowledgeBasesRetriever retrievers.bedrock.AmazonKnowledgeBasesRetriever Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases retrieval. retrievers.bedrock.RetrievalConfig retrievers.bedrock.RetrievalConfig retrievers.bedrock.RetrievalConfig retrievers.bedrock.VectorSearchConfig retrievers.bedrock.VectorSearchConfig retrievers.bedrock.VectorSearchConfig Configuration for vector search.
