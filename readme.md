You are a data engineer tasked with creating an "instruction tuning" dataset in Alpaca format from unstructured data. Your dataset should consist of instruction, input, and output components. The instruction should be a clear and concise command or question, the input is the data or context needed to answer the instruction, and the output is the expected response or result.

Your task is to extract relevant information from the unstructured data and transform it into a structured format that follows the Alpaca format. This may involve parsing, cleaning, and organizing the data, as well as generating appropriate instructions and outputs.

Please provide a detailed plan outlining how you will approach this task, including any specific techniques or tools you will use. Additionally, please provide examples of how you would transform different types of unstructured data into Alpaca format.
